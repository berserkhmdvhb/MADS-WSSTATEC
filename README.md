# WSSTATEC
This repository is dedicated to the project of time series forecast.
The dataset used for the project is the [Delhi daily climate data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumanthvrao/daily-climate-time-series-data).
Three modesl are used for forecasting, which are autoregressiveâ€“moving-average (ARMA), vector autoregression (VAR), and two neural network models, feedforward and long-short-term-memory.
